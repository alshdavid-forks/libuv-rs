/// Poll handles are used to watch file descriptors for readability, writability and disconnection
/// similar to the purpose of poll(2).
///
/// The purpose of poll handles is to enable integrating external libraries that rely on the event
/// loop to signal it about the socket status changes, like c-ares or libssh2. Using PollHandle for
/// any other purpose is not recommended; TcpHandle, UdpHandle, etc. provide an implementation that
/// is faster and more scalable than what can be achieved with PollHandle, especially on Windows.
///
/// It is possible that poll handles occasionally signal that a file descriptor is readable or
/// writable even when it isnâ€™t. The user should therefore always be prepared to handle EAGAIN or
/// equivalent when it attempts to read from or write to the fd.
///
/// It is not okay to have multiple active poll handles for the same socket, this can cause libuv
/// to busyloop or otherwise malfunction.
///
/// The user should not close a file descriptor while it is being polled by an active poll handle.
/// This can cause the handle to report an error, but it might also start polling another socket.
/// However the fd can be safely closed immediately after a call to stop() or close().
///
/// Note: On windows only sockets can be polled with poll handles. On Unix any file descriptor that
/// would be accepted by poll(2) can be used.
///
/// Note: On AIX, watching for disconnection is not supported.
